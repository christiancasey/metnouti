# 𓊹𓌃 (metnouti)
*An esoteric programming language in Egyptian hieroglyphs*

## Overview

𓊹𓌃 (Latinized: metnouti, IPA: [mɛtʰ'nutɪ]) is an experimental, [esolang]() designed around the idea of writing code using the Unicode Egyptian Hieroglyphic block.

By definition, all code in a 𓊹𓌃 program must be written entirely in Egyptian hieroglyphs. (The only exception is string literals, which may use any script, though every effort should be made to use hieroglyphs here as well.)

## Syntax

Every 𓊹𓌃 program begins with `𓆓𓌃`, which tells the compiler that everything from that point to the end of the file is code in the 𓊹𓌃 language.
