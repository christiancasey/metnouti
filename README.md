# 𓊹𓌃
# (metnouti)
*An esoteric programming language in Egyptian hieroglyphs*

## Overview

𓊹𓌃 (Latinized: metnouti, IPA: [mɛtʰ'nutɪ]) is an experimental [esolang](https://esolangs.org) designed on the premise of writing code using the [Unicode Egyptian Hieroglyphic block](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U13000.pdf). 
At present, it has no practical value whatsoever and should not be used by anyone.

By definition, all 𓊹𓌃 programs are stored in UTF-8 text files with the extension `.𓊹𓌃`.
Also by definition, all code in a 𓊹𓌃 program must be written entirely in Egyptian hieroglyphs. 
	(An exception is made for string literals, which may use any script,
	though every effort should be made to use hieroglyphs here as well.)

### Basic Usage

(N.B. This repo include a virtual environment, obnoxiously named 𓇾.)

    ./𓉐𓋹𓉐 [program].𓊹𓌃

To run the example program, type:

    ./𓉐𓋹𓉐 𓏞𓏤.𓊹𓌃

## Syntax

A 𓊹𓌃 program begins with `𓆓𓌃`, which tells the compiler that everything from that point to the end of the file is code in the 𓊹𓌃 language. This initial phrase may appear below a heading, which will be ignored and therefore may be written in any script.
